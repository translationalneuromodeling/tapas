Purpose
-------

The general purpose of this Matlab toolbox is the model-based physiological noise 
correction of fMRI data using peripheral measures of respiration and cardiac 
pulsation. It incorporates noise models of cardiac/respiratory phase (RETROICOR, 
Glover et al. 2000), as well as heart rate variability and respiratory 
volume per time (cardiac response function, Chang et. al, 2009, respiratory 
response function, Birn et al. 2006), and extended motion models. 
While the toolbox is particularly well integrated with SPM via the Batch Editor GUI, its 
simple output nuisance regressor text files can be incorporated into any major 
neuroimaging analysis package.

Core design goals for the toolbox were: *flexibility*, *robustness*, and *quality assurance* 
to enable physiological noise correction for large-scale and multi-center studies. 

Some highlights:
1. Robust automatic preprocessing of peripheral recordings via iterative peak 
   detection, validated in noisy data and patients.
2. Flexible support of peripheral data formats (Siemens, Philips, HCP, GE, Biopac, ...) 
   and noise models (RETROICOR, RVHRCOR).
3. Fully automated noise correction and performance assessment for group studies.
4. Integration in fMRI pre-processing pipelines as SPM Toolbox (Batch Editor GUI).

The accompanying technical paper about the toolbox concept and methodology 
can be found at: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jneumeth.2016.10.019


Installation
------------

### Matlab
1. Unzip the TAPAS archive in your folder of choice
2. Open Matlab
3. Go to `/your/path/to/tapas/physio/code`
4. Run `tapas_physio_init()` in Matlab


*Note*: Step (4) executes the following steps, which you could do manually as well.
- Adds the `physio/code/` folder to your Matlab path
- Adds SPM to your Matlab path (you can enter it manually, if not found)
- Links the folder (Linux/Max) or copies the folder (Windows) `physio/code/` to `/your/path/to/SPM/toolbox/PhysIO`, if the PhysIO code is not already found there  

Only the first point is necessary for using PhysIO standalone with Matlab.
The other two points enable PhysIO's SPM integration, i.e., certain functionality 
(Batch Editor GUI, pipeline dependencies, model assessment via F-contrasts).


Getting Started
---------------

...following the installation, you can try out an example:

1. Download the TAPAS examples via running `tapas_download_example_data()` 
   (found in `misc`-subfolder of TAPAS)
    - The PhysIO Example files will be downloaded to `tapas/examples/<tapas-version>/PhysIO`
2. Run `philips_ecg3t_matlab_script.m` in subdirectory `Philips/ECG3T`
3. See subdirectory `physio/docs` and the next two section of this document for help.

You may try any of the examples in the other vendor folders as well.

Background
----------

The PhysIO Toolbox provides physiological noise correction for fMRI-data 
from peripheral measures (ECG/pulse oximetry, breathing belt). It is 
model-based, i.e. creates nuisance regressors from the physiological 
monitoring that can enter a General Linear Model (GLM) analysis, e.g. 
SPM8/12. Furthermore, for scanner vendor logfiles (PHILIPS, GE, Siemens), 
it provides means to statistically assess peripheral data (e.g. heart rate variability) 
and recover imperfect measures (e.g. distorted R-peaks of the ECG).

Facts about physiological noise in fMRI:
- Physiological noise can explain 20-60 % of variance in fMRI voxel time 
  series (Birn2006, Hutton2011, Harvey2008)
    - Physiological noise affects a lot of brain regions (s. figure, e.g. 
      brainstem or OFC), especially next to CSF, arteries (Hutton2011). 
    - If not accounted for, this is a key factor limiting sensitivity for effects of interest.
- Physiological noise contributions increase with field strength; they 
  become a particular concern at and above 3 Tesla (Kasper2009, Hutton2011).
- In resting state fMRI, disregarding physiological noise leads to wrong 
  connectivity results (Birn2006).
- Uncorrected physiological noise introduces serial correlations into the residual
  voxel time series, that invalidate assumptions on noise correlations (e.g., AR(1)) 
  used in data prewhitening by all major analysis packages. This issue is particularly
  aggravated at short TR (<1s), and most of its effects can be suitably addressed
  by physiological noise correction (Bollmann2018)

Therefore, some kind of physiological noise correction is highly recommended for
every statistical fMRI analysis.

Model-based correction of physiological noise: 
- Physiological noise can be decomposed into periodic time series following 
  heart rate and breathing cycle.
- The Fourier expansion of cardiac and respiratory phases was introduced as 
  RETROICOR (RETROspective Image CORrection, Glover2000, 
  see also Josephs1997).
- These Fourier Terms can enter a General Linear Model (GLM) as nuisance 
  regressors, analogous to movement parameters.
- As the physiological noise regressors augment the GLM and explain 
  variance in the time series, they increase sensitivity in all contrasts 
  of interest.

		
Features of this Toolbox
------------------------

### Physiological Noise Modeling

- Modeling physiological noise regressors from peripheral data 
  (breathing belt, ECG, pulse oximeter) 
    - State of the art RETROICOR cardiac and respiratory phase expansion
    - Cardiac response function (Chang et al, 2009) and respiratory response 
      function (Birn et al. 2006) modelling of heart-rate variability and 
      respiratory volume  per time influence on physiological noise
    - Flexible expansion orders to model different contributions of cardiac, 
      respiratory and interaction terms (see Harvey2008, Hutton2011)
- Data-driven noise regressors
    - PCA extraction from nuisance ROIs (CSF, white matter), similar to aCompCor 
      (Behzadi2007)

### Automatization and Performance Assessment

- Automatic creation of nuisance regressors, full integration into standard 
  GLMs, tested for SPM8/12 ("multiple_regressors.mat")
- Integration in SPM Batch Editor: GUI for parameter input, dependencies to 
  integrate physiological noise correction in preprocessing pipeline
- Performance Assessment: Automatic F-contrast and tSNR Map creation and display 
  for groups of physiological noise regressors, using SPM GLM tools via 
  `tapas_physio_report_contrasts()`.

### Flexible Read-in

The toolbox is dedicated to seamless integration into a clinical research 
setting and therefore offers correction methods to recover physiological 
data from imperfect peripheral measures. Read-in of the following formats is 
currently supported (alphabetic order):

- Biopac `.mat` and `.txt` -export
- Brain Imaging Data Structure ([BIDS](http://bids.neuroimaging.io/bids_spec.pdf) for `*_physio.tsv[.gz]/.json` files)
- Custom logfiles: should contain one amplitude value per line, one logfile per 
  device. Sampling interval(s) are provided as a separate parameter to the toolbox.
- General Electric
- Philips SCANPHYSLOG files (all versions from release 2.6 to 5.3)
- Siemens VB (files `.ecg`, `.resp`, `.puls`)
- Siemens VD (files `*_ECG.log`, `*_RESP.log`, `*_PULS.log`)
- Siemens Human Connectome Project (preprocessed files `*Physio_log.txt`)

See also the 
[Wiki page on Read-In](https://gitlab.ethz.ch/physio/physio-doc/wikis/MANUAL_PART_READIN)
