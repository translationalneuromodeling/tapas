- Unit/Integration tests for filtered traces (cardiac and respiratory) switched to absolute tolerances (relative problematic for traces close to zero)

Minor Release Notes (v8.1.0)
----------------------------

### Added
- Compatibility of whole code base with Matlab compiler in order to run `spm_make_standalone`
    - provides oppurtunity to run SPM Batch Editor GUI version of PhysIO without Matlab license requirement 
    - compiled version readily available within [Neurodesk](https://neurodesk.github.io/tutorials/functional_imaging/physio/) 
- BIDS Read-in for separate cardiac/respiratory trace files (e.g., due to different sampling frequencies)
    - see GitHub Issue #164 and pull request #167 by @alexsayal
    - Additional unit tests for new read-in and example data

### Changed

- Typos in unused function (spotted in compilation)
- Synchronization SIEMENS AcquisitionLog / Physiological files (see Github issue #172)
    - better visualization of sync, clearer error messages if dummy scans not found

Bugfix Release Notes (v8.0.1)
-----------------------------

### Changed
- Citation of novel [TAPAS paper](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.680811) in README and CITATION


Major Release Notes (v8.0.0)
----------------------------

### Added
- New method for computing respiratory volume per unit time (RVT) via the
  Hilbert transform.
    - Publication: Harrison et al., "A Hilbert-based method for processing
      respiratory timeseries", NeuroImage, 2021.
      <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.117787>
    - This is now the default option, but the old method is available by
      setting `physio.model.rvt.method = 'peaks'` (or the equivalent within
      the SPM batch editor).

- Respiratory preprocessing now includes an optional de-spiking step based on
  median filtering.

### Changed
- Now possible to change the frequencies of the respiratory filtering during
  preprocessing via `physio.preproc.respiratory.filter` (or the equivalent
  within the SPM batch editor).

- More robust detrending of raw respiratory timeseries via windowed padding
  before filtering.

### Fixed


Bugfix Release Notes (v7.3.2)
-----------------------------

### Added
- version number `physio.version` in physio-struct (Gitlab issue #101)

### Fixed
- Subfolder of SPM in path (fieldtrip) created ambiguous function calls 
  to overloaded functions (Gitlab issue #102 and Gihub issue #110)
    - e.g., `filtfilt` in `tapas_physio_filter_respiratory` created flat 
      regressors for v7.3 for Siemens VD example dataset
    - now subfolders of SPM will be removed when calling
     `tapas_physio_main_create_regressors`


Bugfix Release Notes (v7.3.1)
-----------------------------

### Fixed
- PPU read-in works for BioPac mat-file now 
    - correct column labels and cardiac modality (Github Issue #103)
    - thank you to Manon Durand-Ruel @mdurandruel for reporting  


Minor Release Notes (R2020a, v7.3.0)
------------------------------------

### Added
- Added descriptive names for the multiple regressors matrix.
    - Closes GitLab issue #82.
    - Now possible to straightforwardly inspect `physio.model.R` and the
      contents of `physio.model.output_multiple_regressors` using
      `physio.model.R_column_names`.
    - Added `tapas_physio_guess_regressor_names()` to maintain backwards
      compatibility.
- New example datasets Siemens VB PPU3T with DICOM Sync (courtesy of Alexander Ritter, Jena, Germany)
- More versatile control on figure visibility, saving and closing during `main` and `review` runs of PhysIO
    - feature provided by Stephan Heunis, TU Eindhoven, The Netherlands (github issue #89)
    - figures can now be plotted in the background without disturbing interactive Matlab sessions, and can be (more) selectively saved and closed during execution of `tapas_physio_review`
    - more comprehensive support within `tapas_physio_main_create_regressors` to follow


Bugfix Release Notes (v7.2.8)
-----------------------------

### Fixed
- Bug(s) when checking SPM and PhysIO paths in `tapas_physio_init` under
  certain particular Matlab path environment settings (Gitlab merge request !37)
    - e.g., when add `physio-public/code` manually without subfolder
    - or if spm existed as a folder name without being added to path


Bugfix Release Notes (v7.2.7)
-----------------------------

### Changed
- Reimplemented `tapas_physio_filter_respiratory.m`.
    - Closes GitLab issue #98.
    - Reduces the cut-off frequency of the high-pass filter, so as to behave
      more like a detrending step. Previous value of 0.1 Hz could distort e.g.
      sigh breaths, which can easily last upwards of 10 s.
    - Reimplements the filters themselves, with a higher filter order, extra
      padding, and a two step high-pass and low-pass procedure (i.e. rather
      than band pass) to improve the overall stability.


Bugfix Release Notes (v7.2.6)
-----------------------------

### Fixed
- Meaningful error message for `auto_matched` peak detection, if time series is too short
    - at least 20 peaks (and pulse templates) are required to create a pulse template
    - this is now stated explicitly, if time series is too short
    - reported by Joy Schuurmans Stekhoven, TNU, as gitlab issue #92


Bugfix Release Notes (v7.2.5)
-----------------------------

### Fixed
- Corrected documentation for ` preproc.cardiac.initial_cpulse_select.min` parameter
    - threshold for peak relative to z-scored time series, *not* correlation
    - reported by Sam Harrison, TNU, as gitlab issue #95


Bugfix Release Notes (v7.2.4)
-----------------------------

### Fixed
- Stop docked figure default throwing error with `-nodisplay`
    - allows generating saved figure without a display, e.g., on remote server
    - bugfix provided by Sam Harrison, TNU


Bugfix Release Notes (v7.2.3)
-----------------------------

### Fixed
- Bugfix manual peak selection (Github issue #85, Gitlab #90)
    - did not work because of figure handling


Bugfix Release Notes (v7.2.2)
-----------------------------

### Fixed
- Bugfix Siemens VB (`*.resp, *.puls, *.ecg`)
    - Synchronization to DICOM time stamp did not work for extended physiological recordings (not starting/ending with functional run) due to ignored absolute start time stamp
    - reported by Alexander Ritter, Jena, Germany (Github issue #55, Gitlab #87)
    - probably fixes Github issue #63 (Gitlab #86) as well


Bugfix Release Notes (v7.2.1)
-----------------------------

### Changed
- PhysIO: removed Matlab statistics toolbox dependency for PCA by SVD implementation (thanks to Beno√Æt Beranger, [pull request 64](https://github.com/translationalneuromodeling/tapas/pull/64))
    - new function `tapas_physio_pca` allows for switch between stats and native SVD implementation of PCA
    - comes with unit tests checking equivalency


Minor Release Notes (R2019b, v7.2.0)
------------------------------------

### Added
- `requirements.txt` making dependencies on Matlab and specific toolboxes 
  explicit
- `max_heart_rate_bpm` now a user parameter to adjust prior on max allowed 
  heart rate for cardiac pulse detection (`method = 'auto_matched'`)

  (`preproc.cardiac.filter`)
- Added integration tests for all examples in `tests/integration` for both SPM
Batch Editor and Matlab-only configuration scripts. Reference data provided in
`examples/TestReferenceResults/examples`

### Changed
- Toned down and replaced irrelevant peak height and missing cardiac pulse 
  warnings (github issue #51)
- Updated README to include external contributors and recent findings about
  impact of physiological noise for serial correlations (Bollmann2018)
- Added unit tests for convolution and moved all to `tests/unit`

### Fixed
- Corrected half-width shift of response functions for HRV and RVT regressors by
  erroneous use of Matlab `conv` 
    - For details on the bug, its impact and fix, see our specific [Release
    Info on RVT/HRV Bugfix](https://github.com/translationalneuromodeling/tapas/issues/65)
    - other references: TNU gitlab issue #83, found and fixed by Sam Harrison,
    TNU, see `tapas_physio_conv`)
- Bugfix `tapas_physio_init()` not working, because dependent on functions 
  in `utils` subfolder not in path; `utils` added to path
- `tapas_physio_review` for motion parameters (found and fixed by 
  Sam Harrison, TNU)
- visualization error for regressor orthogonalization (github issue #57), 
  when only `'RETROICOR'` set was chosen

    - updated deployment `tapas_physio_init` because of that
    - updated figure names to reflect respective code module
- matlab-script examples now contain more comments
    - fixed internal bug that prepended absolute paths to input logfiles in automatic example generation
- `tapas_physio_create_noise_rois_regressors` with more flexible ROI reslicing
