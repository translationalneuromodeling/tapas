% estimates cardiac phases from cardiac pulse data
%
% USAGE
%   cardiac_phase = tapas_physio_get_cardiac_phase(pulset,scannert, verbose, svolpulse)
%
% INPUT
%        pulset     - heart-beat/pulseoxymeter data read from spike file
%        scannert   - scanner slice pulses read from log file
%        verbose    - set verbose.level >=3, if figures for debugging are wanted
%        svolpulse  - volume start pulses from log file (only for plot reasons)
%
% OUTPUT
%        cardiac_phase - phase in heart-cycle when each slice of each
%        volume was acquired
%        fh         - figure handle
%
% The regressors are calculated as described in
% Glover et al, 2000, MRM, (44) 162-167
% Josephs et al, 1997, ISMRM, p1682
