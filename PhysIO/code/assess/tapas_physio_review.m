%
%   verbose = tapas_physio_review(physio, newVerboseLevel)
%
% NOTE: Change physio.verbose.level before running this function to get
%       additonal output plots not seen during executing of the main-function
%
% NOTE1: Change the following flags prior to running this function in order
% to control the output figure behavior.
%   physio.verbose.show_figs = false; (default true)
%   physio.verbose.save_figs = true; (default false)
%   physio.verbose.close_figs = true; (default false)
% An example use case is to disable figure outputs when running
% tapas_physio_main_create_regressors (by setting physio.verbose.level = 0)
% and then running tapas_physio_review in order to generate the figures.
% Figures can, for example, be generated and saved in the background
% (show_figs = false, save_figs = true) or displayed and not saved
% (show_figs = true, save_figs = false).
%
% NOTE2: This is not an exact copy of the plotting behavior within
% tapas_physio_main_create_regressors (yet). The most important plots for
% diagnostics should show up, though.
