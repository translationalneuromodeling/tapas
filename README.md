-----------
DESCRIPTION
-----------

TAPAS is a collection of algorithms and software tools developed by the
Translational Neuromodeling Unit (TNU, Zurich) and collaborators. These 
tools are intended to support the development of computational assays 
(Translational Neuromodeling) and their clinical application in 
Computational Psychiatry, Neurology and Psychosomatics.

Currently, TAPAS includes the following packages:

- [ceode](ceode/README.md): Continuous Extension of ODE methods. A toolbox for robust estimation of convolution based Dynamic Causal Models (DCMs) for evoked responses (ERPs). 
- [genbed](genbed/README.md): A Python package for data exploration and classification as part of the **gen**erative em**bed**ding pipeline.
- [HGF](HGF/README.md): The Hierarchical Gaussian Filter; Bayesian inference
  on computational processes from observed behaviour.
- [HUGE](huge/README.md): Variational Bayesian inversion for hierarchical
unsupervised generative embedding (HUGE).
- [PhysIO](PhysIO/README.md): Physiological Noise Correction for fMRI.
- [rDCM](rDCM/README.md): Regression dynamic causal modeling; efficient inference on whole-brain effective connectivity from fMRI data.
- [SEM](sem/README.md): SERIA Model for Eye Movements (saccades and anti-saccades) and Reaction Times.

And the following tasks:
- [FDT](task/FDT/README.md): Filter Detection Task.
- [BLT](task/BLT/README.md): Breathing Learning Task.


TAPAS also includes beta versions of the following toolboxes. Please note that these toolboxes have not been extensively tested and are still in active development:
- [UniQC](UniQC/README.md): unified neuroimaging quality control.


TAPAS is written in MATLAB and Python and distributed as open source code under
the GNU General Public License (GPL, Version 3).

If you cannot find the toolbox you were looking for in the downloaded version, 
you might find it in the [TAPAS Legacy repository](https://tnurepository.ethz.ch/TNU/tapas/-/tree/development).

------------
INSTALLATION
------------

TAPAS is a collection of toolboxes written in MATLAB (Version R2016b) and Python. 
- The key requirement is the installation of MATLAB (produced by The MathWorks, Inc.
Natick, MA, USA. http://www.mathworks.com/). 
- Toolboxes written in Python currently include: 
    - genbed: For requirements see the genbed [documentation](genbed/README.md).

Please download TAPAS from our
[Github Release Page](https://github.com/translationalneuromodeling/tapas/releases).

To add the TAPAS directory to the MATLAB path, run the script `tapas_init.m` in
the directory where tapas is installed/extracted.

For the individual toolboxes included in TAPAS, please refer to their
documentation (s.b.) for specific installation instructions.

To download the example data please use `tapas_download_example_data()` from
the matlab console.

-------------
DOCUMENTATION
-------------

- The latest documentation of TAPAS can be found in this README and on the
  [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/translationalneuromodeling/tapas/wiki) of the
  [TAPAS GitHub page](https://github.com/translationalneuromodeling/tapas).
- In general, each toolbox comes with their own documentation as Wiki, PDF,
  matlab tutorials etc.
- Documentation for older versions (<= 2.7.0.0) is provided on the
  [TNU page](https://www.tnu.ethz.ch/de/software/tapas/documentations).


-------
SUPPORT
-------

- Please submit bug reports, feature requests, code improvements etc. via the
  [Issues](https://github.com/translationalneuromodeling/tapas/issues) Forum pages
  on GitHub (you will need a GitHub account.
- This issue forum is searchable, so please have a look if your question has
  been asked before.
- For older versions or more general questions, please also have a look at our
  now deprecated E-Mail List, which has a searchable [Archive](https://sympa.ethz.ch/sympa/arc/tapas).
