rDCM - regression Dynamic Causal Modeling.
========================================================================

This ReadMe file provides the relevant information on the regression dynamic causal modeling (rDCM)
toolbox.

> **_NOTE:_** There is a new implementation of rDCM in Julia which can be found [here](https://github.com/ComputationalPsychiatry/RegressionDynamicCausalModeling.jl).

-------
Purpose
-------

The regression dynamic causal modeling (rDCM) toolbox implements a novel variant 
of DCM for fMRI that enables computationally efficient inference on effective (i.e.,
directed) connectivity parameters among brain regions. Due to its
computational efficiency, inversion of large (whole-brain) networks becomes feasible.

For the accompanying technical papers, detailing the methodology presented in this toolbox,
please see [Frässle et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S105381191730201X?via%3Dihub) 
and [Frässle et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811918304762?via%3Dihub).



------------
Installation
------------

### Matlab ###
1. Unzip the TAPAS archive in your folder of choice
2. Open Matlab
3. Add the rDCM Toolbox to your Matlab path
4. Use the [Manual](docs/Manual.pdf) and the tutorial script `tapas_rdcm_tutorial()` as starting points



---------------
Important Notes
---------------

Please note that rDCM is a method that is still in an early stage of development and thus subject to 
various limitations. Due to these limitations, requirements of rDCM in terms of 
fMRI data quality (i.e., fast TR, high SNR) are high. For data that does not
meet these conditions, the method might not give reliable results. It remains the 
responsibility of each user to ensure that his/her dataset fulfills these 
requirements. Please refer to the main toolbox references (see below) for more 
detailed explanations.



---------------
Contact/Support
---------------

We are very happy to provide support on how to use the rDCM Toolbox. However, 
due to time constraints, we might not provide a detailed answer to your request, 
but just some general pointers and templates. Before you contact us, please try the following:

1. First, look at the [Manual](docs/Manual.pdf) and the tutorial script `tapas_rdcm_tutorial()` as starting points for answers to your questions.
2. For new requests, we would like to ask you to submit them as 
   [issues](https://github.com/translationalneuromodeling/tapas/issues) on our github release page for TAPAS.
