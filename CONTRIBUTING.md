Contributing Guide for TAPAS Software Suite
===========================================

Purpose
-------

This guide describes how to contribute to the Translational Algorithms for Psychiatry-Advancing Science (TAPAS) software suite, developed at the Translational Neuromodeling Unit, and colleagues around the world.

TAPAS is a collection of different tools and algorithms, maintained by different people, all with their own coding style and preferences. This document should give you some guidance on the underlying principles to adhere when contributing to TAPAS.

This guide shall help you to contribute efficiently to an existing toolbox ([TAPAS Contributors](#tapas-contributors))


TAPAS Contributors
------------------

### How to Contribute ###
- Start a discussion on feature requests or report bugs via GitHub Issues
- Please provide code for TAPAS exclusively via submitting *Pull Requests* on GitHub
    - You will be prompted to accept the [Contributor License Agreement](https://gist.github.com/mrikasper/cf06aab2a03c257aaa60ad1fe469b7d0#file-contributor-license-agreement-md)
    - This procedure ensures the continued legal maintainability of the TAPAS software suite.
    - Have a look at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement) for details on the rationale and legal implications of a CLA. Here is a quote of the essence:
    
    > The purpose of a CLA is to ensure that the guardian of a project's outputs has
    > the necessary ownership or grants of rights over all contributions to allow 
    > them to distribute under the chosen license. 

### Coding and Style Guidelines ###
- in general, similar to Matlab
- have a look at individual toolbox you want to contribute
    - try to adhere to style
    - document well, use same header in functions
    - have a look whether toolbox has its own CONTRIBUTING document
