This includes, at University of Zurich's option, the right to sublicense these same rights to third parties through multiple levels of sublicensees or other licensing arrangements;
    - Contributor agrees that University of Zurich can do all things in relation to Contributions as if University of Zurich were the sole owner, and if University of Zurich makes a derivative work of a Contribution, the one who makes the derivative work (or has it made) will be the sole owner of that derivative work;

4.  Rights of Contributor

    6.5 Should some or several provisions of this Agreement be ineffective or invalid, or should there be an omission in this Agreement, the effectiveness, respectively the validity of the remaining provisions shall not be affected thereby.
