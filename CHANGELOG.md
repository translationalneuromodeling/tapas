### Known issues
- TAPAS uses the mcmcdiag toolbox for Monte Carlo convergence diagnostics, which shadows a number of matlab built-in functions. Affected functions include: Contents.m, cusum.m, join.m and score.m. Workaround: If you use one of these functions in your own code, remove the tapas folder from your matlab path when you are not using the TAPAS toolbox.
